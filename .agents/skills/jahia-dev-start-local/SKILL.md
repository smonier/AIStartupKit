description: Starts a local Jahia instance for development and guides the user through creating their first site. Use this after creating a template set to get a running Jahia environment.

## Overview

This skill starts a local Jahia instance for development. Two approaches are available depending on the environment. Try Docker first; fall back to bare metal only if Docker is not an option.

---

## Step 1 — Try Docker first (recommended)

Check if Docker is available:

```bash
docker info
```

- If the command **succeeds** → proceed with Docker (Step 2)
- If the command **fails with a connection error** → Docker Desktop is likely not running. Tell the user: **"Please start Docker Desktop and try again."** Then retry `docker info`.
- If Docker is **not installed** → skip to Step 3 (bare metal fallback)

---

## Step 2 — Start with Docker Compose

From the module directory (where `docker-compose.yml` lives):

```bash
docker compose up --wait
```

This will:
- Pull and start a local Jahia instance
- Wait until Jahia is fully ready before returning

Once up, Jahia will be available at **http://localhost:8080**.

**Tell the user the URL and credentials** (default: `root` / `root1234` — can only be changed in `docker-compose.yml`).

Then ask the user to run the following command **themselves in a separate terminal** — do NOT run it on their behalf, as it produces continuous feedback they need to see:

```
👉 In a new terminal, from the module directory, run:

    yarn dev

This watches for file changes and pushes the compiled template set to the running Jahia instance. Leave it running while you develop.
```

> **Agent note:** `yarn dev` is for interactive human development only. When building features programmatically, always use `yarn build && yarn jahia-deploy` for explicit one-shot deploys — never start `yarn dev` from an agent.

---

## Step 3 — Bare metal fallback (no Docker)

If Docker is not available, Jahia can be run locally with a JVM.

Fetch the latest download and setup instructions from:

> https://academy.jahia.com/downloads

Key requirements:
- A working JVM (Java 11 or 17)
- The Jahia distribution ZIP or installer from the downloads page

Follow the instructions on that page for the user's platform, then return here to deploy with `yarn build && yarn jahia-deploy` once Jahia is started.

---

## Step 4 — Create a new site in Jahia

Once the initial deploy has pushed the template set to Jahia, guide the user through creating their first site:

1. Open **http://localhost:8080** and log in with `root` / `root1234`
2. Click **My projects** → **Create New** → **Create**
3. Fill in the site creation form (site name, server name, default language)
4. Select the template set created in the previous step (e.g. `llm-academy`)
5. Click **Next** then **Save**
6. Open **Page Builder** — the Hello World page should be visible ✨

Tell the user: **"Your site is ready! Open Page Builder to start editing your pages."**

---

## Validation checklist
- [ ] `docker info` succeeds (or bare metal Jahia is running)
- [ ] `docker compose up --wait` completes without errors (Docker path)
- [ ] Jahia UI is reachable at http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Module deployed to Jahia (`yarn build && yarn jahia-deploy` run; or `yarn dev` in user terminal for interactive development)
- [ ] User has created a new site using the template set
- [ ] Page Builder opens and shows the Hello World page

## Troubleshooting

If anything goes wrong during setup or startup, refer to the official Jahia front-end developer setup guide:
